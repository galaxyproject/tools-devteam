description: Depth of Coverage on BAM files
long_description: |
  DepthOfCoverage processes a set of bam files to determine coverage
  at different levels of partitioning and aggregation. Coverage can be analyzed per
  locus, per interval, per gene, or in total; can be partitioned by sample, by read
  group, by technology, by center, or by library; and can be summarized by mean, median,
  quartiles, and/or percentage of bases covered to or beyond a threshold. Additionally,
  reads and bases can be filtered by mapping or base quality score.
