description: snpFreq significant SNPs in case-control data
long_description: |
  This tool performs a basic analysis of bi-allelic SNPs in case-control
  data, using the R statistical environment and Fisher''s exact test to identify SNPs
  with a significant difference in the allele frequencies between the two groups.  R''s
  "qvalue" package is used to correct for multiple testing.
