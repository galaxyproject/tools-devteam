long_description: |
  TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns
  RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput short read
  aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice junctions
  between exons. Please cite: Trapnell, C., Pachter, L. and Salzberg, S.L. TopHat:
  discovering splice junctions with RNA-Seq. Bioinformatics 25, 1105-1111 (2009).
