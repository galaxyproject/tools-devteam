description: Statistical approach for the Identification of ChIP-Enriched Regions
long_description: |
  SICER first and foremost is a filtering tool. Its main functions are:

  1. Delineation of the significantly ChIP-enriched regions, which can be used to
  associate with other genomic landmarks.
  2. Identification of reads on the ChIP-enriched regions, which can be used for profiling
  and other quantitative analysis.
