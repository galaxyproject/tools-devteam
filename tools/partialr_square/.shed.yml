description: Compute partial R square
long_description: |
  This tool computes the Partial R squared for all possible variable
  subsets using the following formula:
  Partial R squared = [SSE(without i: 1,2,...,p-1) - SSE (full: 1,2,..,i..,p-1) /
  SSE(without i: 1,2,...,p-1)], which denotes the case where the ''i''th predictor
  is dropped.
