description: Compute P-values and Correlation Coefficients for Occurrences of Two
  Set of Features
long_description: |
  This program generates plots and computes table matrix of coefficient
  correlations and p-values at multiple scales for the correlation between the occurrences
  of features in one dataset and their occurrences in another using multiscale wavelet
  analysis technique.
